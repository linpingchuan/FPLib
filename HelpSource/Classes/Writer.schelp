summary:: Writer Monad
categories::FP

The writer monad allows a program to compute various kinds of auxiliary output which can be "composed" or "accumulated" step-by-step, in addition to the main result of a computation. It is often used for logging or profiling. Given the underlying type T, a value in the writer monad has type W Ã— T, where W is a type endowed with an operation satisfying the monoid laws.

Examples::
code::

x = Writer( 1, ["a number 1"] );
y = Writer( 2, ["a number 2"] );

x >>= { |x| y.collect{ |y| x + y } };

//applicative style
(_+_) <%> x <*> y


x.tell([" and something else "])
